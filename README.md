# Photosynthesis-quantum-simulation
See the file "non_resonant_with_decoherence" for comments (at the end of the script) about the parameters used. 
For instance, how to change the fluctuation strengths, add or remove fluctuators and change the fluctuators switching rate.
The comments are applied to the "resonant_with decoherence" script as well.
In the no decoherence simulations, the quantum circuit is defined to be run in the IBMQ quantum computer "ibmq_london".
