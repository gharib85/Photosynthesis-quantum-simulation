See the file "non_resonance_with_decoherence" for comments (at the end of the script) about how to change the fluctuation strengths, add or remove fluctuators and change the fluctuators switching rate, etc. These parameters can be similarly changed in the script "near_resonance_with_decoherence".

In the no decoherence simulations, the quantum circuit is defined to be run in the IBMQ quantum computer "ibmq_london".
